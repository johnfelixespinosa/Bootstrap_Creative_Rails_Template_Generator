# Pretty Creative Template Gen

Bare bones rails template generator that takes care of all your assets using the frontend-generator gem.

Start your new rails app with something to work with. 

# How it works
When creating a new rails app simply pass the template file through.

Save the template file locally

Within console `$ rails new mynewapp -m ~/template.rb`  pass the proper path of the template on your system

The template will ask for the name of your app, once everything is compiled you can cd into your new app, start a rails server, and visit [http://localhost:3000/creatives/index](http://localhost:3000/creatives/index
